# antislop

> **Anti Slop: Rules for AI Coding Agents.** It stops them from generating generic "AI slop" UI and copy, without letting the result turn sterile. It is a **filter, not a style guide**: no prescribed colors, fonts, or layouts. It is not only for building pages: it also writes and audits copy, so AI text stops reading like AI. And it never beautifies on its own; `DESIGN.md` (yours) is where beauty and direction come from.

> **New here? Start with the [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md).** It explains what antislop is and how to install it, from zero.

## What it does

- **38 mandatory rules** (R-01 to R-38) in three tiers: Hard Gate (absolute), Purpose-Gate (technique allowed, reason required), Quality Locks (consistency)
- **A Liveliness Toolkit** with three dials (ENERGY / RHYTHM / MOTION) and a Design Read, so the result is alive and specific, not just "clean"
- **A Delivery Gate**: a mandatory PASS/FAIL report in four blocks, run before anything ships
- **Additive skills**, one per concern, so an agent only loads what a task needs

The core prevents slop but cannot invent direction. `DESIGN.md` (yours) supplies it; a sterile result means the direction was missing, not that the filter failed (R-37).

## See the difference

The same brief, the same page, generated four times over. antislop filters; `DESIGN.md` supplies direction. They are two different jobs, and these are the four results. Copy and code follow as before-and-after pairs instead of four separate builds, because nothing else has to supply direction there.

### UI

Three of the four builds. The first uses neither tool, the second only antislop, the third only `DESIGN.md`.

| **Nothing at all** | **antislop alone** | **`DESIGN.md` alone** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| <a href="assets/compare/ui/without.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/without.webp" alt="A generic landing page: a sparkle logo, a NEXT-GEN AI 2.0 beta pill above the headline, and a fake terminal reporting 0.0001ms latency" width="100%"></a> | <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-antislop.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-antislop.webp" alt="The same page with antislop: honest copy on a restrained dark layout with a single accent colour" width="100%"></a> | <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-design.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-design.webp" alt="The same page with DESIGN.md only: a photographic hero, with the stat cards still reading 10,000% ROI Synergy Multiplier and a 5.0 rating from 500,000 founders" width="100%"></a> |
| Where most AI output starts: a sparkle logo, a beta pill, and a fake terminal. | Honest, because the filter removed the invented numbers. Plain, because beauty is not its job. | The direction lands, but the slop stays, because `DESIGN.md` directs and does not filter. |

The fourth uses both, and it is the only one of the four that is clean and directed at the same time:

| **antislop + `DESIGN.md`** |
|:--|
| <a href="assets/compare/ui/w-all.webp"><img src="assets/compare/ui/w-all.webp" alt="The same page with antislop and DESIGN.md: a full-bleed illustrated hero with one honest headline and project-specific navigation" width="100%"></a> |
| Honest numbers and a real direction in the same build. The filter removes what should not be there; `DESIGN.md` fills the space that leaves, which is the one thing neither tool manages alone. |

## Install

antislop ships as a set of **standard agent skills** (one folder per skill, holding a `SKILL.md`). The core is always loaded; the other skills load only when the task needs them. This section is the reference: every install command, in one place. [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) walks through them from zero, and its Update and Remove sections cover every route the same way.

### 1. The installer (recommended)

One command, then answer the prompts. It asks which extra skills you want, where to install (this project or everywhere), and which agents you use, then copies the folders. It is also the only route that writes the pointer reloading antislop every session on a project install; a global install relies on the skills loading themselves by description.

```bash
npx antislop-ai
```

To update later, run the same command and choose **Overwrite them** when it finds the existing folders. Choosing **Keep what is there** installs nothing and leaves you on the old version.

### 2. The skills directory

antislop is listed on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop), the open directory for agent skills:

```bash
npx skills add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

This copies the same folders as path 1 and nothing else: no pointer, so antislop reloads by description alone. [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) covers adding the pointer afterwards, and updating or removing this route.

### 3. The plugin (Claude Code)

Add the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
/plugin install antislop@anti-slop
```

### 4. The plugin (Antigravity)

The same repo is an Antigravity plugin. Install it with the Antigravity CLI:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

### 5. The plugin (Codex)

The same repo is a Codex plugin and marketplace. Add the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
codex plugin add antislop@anti-slop
```

### 6. The plugin (Cursor)

The same repo is a Cursor plugin. Add it as a plugin marketplace with the Cursor Agent CLI:

```bash
agent plugin marketplace add https://github.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop
```

Then open **Customize** in Cursor, find **antislop**, and select **Install**, choosing project or user scope.

### Where the skills live

Every skill is a folder of the open Agent Skills standard (`<name>/SKILL.md`), so it drops into any agent that reads the standard. The installer (path 1) installs into whichever of these you use, creating the folder if it is missing:

| Agent | Reads antislop from |
|-------|---------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `.agents/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` |
| Hermes | `.hermes/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/` |

The Gemini CLI row is legacy support: Antigravity replaced it, but the installer still writes there for existing setups.

Antigravity and Copilot share one folder. Copilot also reads `.github/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`, but the installer writes the folder they have in common, so picking both installs antislop once.

Those are the project paths. A global install writes the same folder under your home directory, with two exceptions: OpenCode writes to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, and Antigravity to `~/.gemini/config/skills/`. Copilot is the one agent that also reads the home-level `.agents/skills/`.

Hermes needs one extra step after a project install: it will not load skills out of a cloned repository until you run `hermes skills trust` once in that project.

### Manual (single file, no packaging)

The core `antislop.md` alone is a complete filter you can paste into any chat window. Download it and tell your agent to read it; the First-Run wizard inside it installs skills the manual way:

```bash
curl -o antislop.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop/main/antislop.md
```

## Skills

| Skill | What it covers | Ships in |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| antislop | The core filter: rules, tiers, Delivery Gate, liveliness | v3.0.0 |
| antislop-ui | UI / visual: layout, color, components, decoration, motion, structure | v2.2.0 |
| antislop-copywriting | Copy & text: headlines, CTAs, tone, fake stats, anti-AI-writing patterns, markdown hygiene | v2.3.0 |
| antislop-human | Human: contrast (with the checker), keyboard, focus, states | v2.4.0 |
| antislop-layoutmobile | Responsive / mobile: reflowing across screen widths (phone to desktop), breakpoints, grids, overflow, tap targets | v2.5.0 |
| antislop-code | Code comments: remove generic AI-slop comments, keep the valuable ones, never touch the code | v3.1.0 |

Pick what matches the work:

- UI work → antislop-ui
- Copy work → antislop-copywriting
- People work → antislop-human
- Responsive layout work → antislop-layoutmobile
- Code comments work → antislop-code
- More than one kind of work → install several
- None → the core alone is a complete filter

## Usage modes

antislop is used one of two ways, chosen at the start of a session:

- **During** guides the work while it is built, ending with the Delivery Gate. Use it when building new UI.
- **After** audits finished work: a numbered findings list, you approve which to fix, then a follow-up report. Use it to clean up existing output.

## Roadmap

**v3.2.10** is the current release.

- **GitHub Copilot is an installer target.** It loads skills from `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills`, so it shares the `.agents/skills` folder other agents already use and reads the same `AGENTS.md` pointer. No new folder, no new file. GitHub's skill support is young, so treat this door as early.
- **The installer stops writing the same skills twice.** Agents that share a folder now share one install instead of one each, and the conflict prompt counts folders rather than agents, so it stops reporting more folders than exist.
- **OpenCode gets told about a collision.** OpenCode reads `.opencode/skills`, `.claude/skills`, and `.agents/skills` at once and documents no precedence between them. When two of those hold antislop, the installer now names both instead of leaving you to find a missing skill later.
- **Claude Code and `AGENTS.md`.** Since v2.1.277 Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` when a project has no `CLAUDE.md`. antislop keeps writing `CLAUDE.md`, because a `CLAUDE.md` anywhere above the working directory makes Claude ignore `AGENTS.md` entirely.
- **Copilot has no plugin door.** The roadmap promised a marketplace command; there is none to ship, because Copilot Extensions in the GitHub Marketplace are applications rather than repo manifests.
- **R-02 stops contradicting itself.** The core called the em dash ban absolute, while `antislop-copywriting` excepted a user's own voice in three places, so the most recognisable AI tell could survive the filter. R-02 now scopes the ban to text the agent writes, and a user's sample goes through R-37 instead: name it, ask, never decide silently.

Every earlier release, and what comes next, is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## FAQ

### Is antislop a style guide?

No, a filter. It does not prescribe colors, fonts, or layouts. It rejects technique without purpose and requires liveliness; direction is yours.

### Which agents does it work with?

All of them, but the install paths differ:

- **The installer and the skills directory** support Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Hermes, and GitHub Copilot (the installer detects each agent's skill folder). These are the recommended paths.
- **The plugins** are per-agent doors: the Claude Code marketplace plugin (path 3), the Antigravity plugin (path 4), the Codex plugin (path 5), and the Cursor plugin (path 6), all installed from the same repo.
- **The single file** (`antislop.md`) works with any agent that reads plain Markdown, including a plain chat window.

The packaged skills use the open Agent Skills standard (folder per skill), so they drop into any tool that reads the standard.

### What is a "skill"?

A folder that goes deeper into one concern (UI, copywriting, accessibility, and so on), holding a `SKILL.md` with its rules. It references the core rules by number and never duplicates them, so adding a skill does not change the core.
